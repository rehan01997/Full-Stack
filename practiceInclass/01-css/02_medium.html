                <p>Ethereum is the most successful blockchain in existence. There, I said it.</p>
                <p>I wish I’d been the first, but Bloomberg writer and author of “Out of the Ether” Matthew Leising beat me to the punch. It’s not just Ethereum’s lofty goal of creating a radically new decentralized internet that makes it better than Bitcoin. It’s what it’s already been able to accomplish in six short years:</p>
                <p>It’s not just Ethereum’s lofty goal of creating a radically new decentralized internet that makes it better than Bitcoin. It’s what it’s already been able to accomplish in six short years:</p>
                <p>Ethereum pioneered Smart Contracts (digital transactions that can eliminate middleman services like Uber, Airbnb, and lawyers, to name a few).</p>
                <p>Ethereum created a successful dApp (decentralized app) ecosystem. The most important altcoins and NFT ecosystems are built on Ethereum’s blockchain today.</p>
                <p>Ethereum created ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) as a means for developers to fund their own projects. This is how an ICO Works: Create a dApp, give yourself and other creators your own cryptocurrency (e.g. Chainlink), and if the project is a success the value of that crypto will go up paying you automagically./p>
                <p>It’s spawned competition with cryptocurrencies like Polkadot, Cardano, and Tron, to name a few.</p>
                <p>Ethereum — more specifically a group of Ethereum developers — created the DAO (Decentralized autonomous organization)</p>

                <h3>What is The DAO?</h3>
                <p>Ethereum works like the internet; it enables other developers to build decentralized applications on top of it. In 2016, one such application was created — the DAO.</p>
                <p>In essence, it was an investor-directed venture capital fund. Anyone who supported the crowdfunding campaign for this app could vote where funds were then allocated towards. Everything was community-run.  </p>
                <p>It predated makeshift funds like Reddit and the GameStop fiasco. It also had far fewer memes about apes going to the moon.</p>
